Our team of developers is creating a block chain to assist major shippers such as UPS and Fedex to locate lost packages by creating a QR Code that when scan displays an image of the contents being shipped.

This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Sender and Receiver and how to manage and audit blockchain package ownership as package is transferred down the supply chain. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Sender can add items to the system stored in the blockchain.Also, Sender can take a picture of the item they send and add that picture to the platform that the Distributor provided to get a QR code to the package. Distributor can mark an item as Shipped, and transporter can add  can mark an item as Received.

Our Supply chain diagrame looks like this...

The DApp User Interface when running looks like this...

# Activity Diagram

The UML activity diagram captures the dynamic behavior of the system. It represents the flow from one activity to another in the system. We use the activity diagram to discover Actors and interactions in the supply chain.
